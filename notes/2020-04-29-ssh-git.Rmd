Once I had ssh-ed into the Merced cluster, I did

```
ssh -vT git@github.com
```
And got: 

```

Then, following [Mathew Hagemann's post][https://medium.com/@mhagemann/how-to-fix-ssh-permission-denied-with-git-clone-f669b65f90ac], I did:

```
ssh-keygen
```
And just hit return for everything.

Then downloaded to my computer the file `id_rsa.pub` that contains the new key, doing:

```
rsync username@merced.ucmerced.edu:.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
```

Copied all the contents of the `id_rsa.pub` file, 
went to my github account >> settings >> ssh >> add a new ssh key, paste those into the window that popped up >> clicked add, and gladly saw that I had a new ssh key there.

Then, went back to my ssh session and did:

```
ssh -T git@github.com
Hi LunaSare! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Then I was finally able to `git clone` into my home on the cluster, yay!!!
